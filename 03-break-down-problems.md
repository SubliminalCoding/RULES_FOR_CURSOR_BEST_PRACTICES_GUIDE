# Break Down Complex Problems

## Summary
Don't just say "Extract text from PDF and generate a summary." That's two problems! Extract text first, then generate the summary. Solve one problem at a time.

## Detailed Explanation
AI is great at solving specific, well-defined problems. When you present a complex task as one big problem, you're more likely to get confused or incomplete solutions. Breaking it down helps both you and the AI focus on solving each part correctly.

## Tips
- Identify distinct steps in your problem
- Tackle each step separately
- Test each part before moving to the next

## Common Mistakes
- Asking AI to solve multiple problems in one prompt
- Not validating intermediate results
- Making prompts too broad or unclear
