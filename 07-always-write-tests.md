# Always Write Tests

## Summary
It might feel unnecessary when your project is small, but when it grows, tests will be your hero.

## Detailed Explanation
When working with AI-generated code, tests become even more crucial. They help verify that the generated code works as intended and catch any misunderstandings between you and the AI. Tests also make it safer to accept AI's suggested changes or refactoring.

## Tips
- Write tests before accepting generated code

## Common Mistakes
- Skipping tests because "it's just a small project"
- Not testing edge cases
- Accepting AI code without test verification
