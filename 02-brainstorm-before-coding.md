# Brainstorm Before Coding

## Summary
Share your thoughts with AI about tackling the problem. Once its solution steps look good, then ask it to write code.

## Detailed Explanation
Jumping straight into code generation can lead to misaligned solutions. By discussing your approach with AI first, you can validate your thinking and identify potential issues early. This pre-coding dialogue helps ensure that both you and the AI have a clear understanding of the problem and solution strategy.
This will reduce the number of prompts needed when writing the code.

## Tips
- Outline your solution strategy before asking for code
- Discuss edge cases and potential challenges
- Document Decisions and Trade-offs
- Let AI suggest alternative approaches, sometimes it gives much better ideas than yours.

## Common Mistakes
- Rushing to get code without proper planning
- Not considering edge cases during discussion, which leads to writing lots of unnecessary code
- Not documenting decisions and their rationales
