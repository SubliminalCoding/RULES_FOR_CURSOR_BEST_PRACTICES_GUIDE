# Getting Unstuck

## Summary
If AI can't find the problem in the code and is stuck in a loop, ask it to insert debugging statements. AI is excellent at debugging, but sometimes needs your help to point it in the right direction.

## Detailed Explanation
When AI gets stuck in a loop or can't identify the issue, it's often because it lacks visibility into what's actually happening at runtime. By asking it to add strategic debugging statements, you can help it understand the actual program flow and state.

## Tips
- Ask AI to add console.logs at key points
- Provide the debugging output back to AI

## Common Mistakes
- Letting AI keep guessing without new information
- Not providing runtime feedback to AI
