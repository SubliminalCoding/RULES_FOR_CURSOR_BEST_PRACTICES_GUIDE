# Chat VS Agent Tabs

## Summary

I use the chat/plan tab for brainstorming/research and the agent/act tab for writing actual code.

## Detailed Explanation

When working with AI tools, understanding the distinct purposes of chat and agent interactions improves your workflow. The chat tab is ideal for exploration and discussion, while the agent tab focuses on specific code implementation.

For example, use chat mode for questions like "I need to build a URL shortener. What's the best approach?" and agent mode for specific tasks like "Create a function that generates a 6-character unique URL".

This separation helps maintain clear context in your AI interactions and reduce your LLM API costs.

## Tips

-   Keep research and exploration in chat tab
-   Use agent tab when ready to write code
-   Start new chats for unrelated topics

## Common Mistakes

-   Using agent tab for open-ended discussions
-   Mixing brainstorming and implementation
-   Keeping context scattered across different tabs
