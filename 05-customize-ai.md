# Customize Your AI

## Summary
Create "Rules for AI" custom instructions to modify your agent's behavior as you progress, or maintain a RulesForAI.md file.

## Detailed Explanation
As you work with AI, you'll discover patterns in its responses that could be improved. Instead of repeatedly correcting these patterns, create custom instructions that guide the AI to follow your preferred practices automatically. This makes your interactions more efficient and consistent.

## Tips
- Update rules based on actual experience and your project needs
- Keep rules clear and specific
- Document why each rule exists
- Focus on patterns you notice repeatedly

## Common Mistakes
- Writing vague or contradictory rules
- Not adapting rules based on project needs
