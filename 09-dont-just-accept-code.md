# Don't Just Accept Working Code

## Summary
It's tempting to just accept code that works and move on. But there will be times when AI can't fix your bugs - that's when your hands need to get dirty (main reason non-tech people still need developers).

## Detailed Explanation
While AI can generate working code quickly, understanding how and why the code works is crucial. When bugs arise, you need to be able to debug and fix them yourself. This understanding also helps you make better use of AI by knowing what to ask for and how to validate its solutions.

## Tips
- Review and understand generated code
- Ask AI to explain complex parts

## Common Mistakes
- Accepting code without understanding it
- Not verifying if the solution is optimal
- Relying entirely on AI
